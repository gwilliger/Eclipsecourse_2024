# Eclipsecourse_2024
Slides for 14 x 50 minute lectures for an academic eclipse course, one credit hour.
These are offered "as they are".  I will revise them from time to time, mostly to fix errors
or make them more legible/attractive.  The filenames contain the revision date.  Teachers
are free to change them as they wish.  The goal is to provide enough material to permit
teaching a course with minimal preparation, but some local customization will probably be necessary.
Please let me know if you are using these slides for a course at gmwill06@louisville.edu
Please include your name, institution/school, the number of students and whether the course
is online or face-to-face.  If there is interest, we can start a Slack channel for teachers to
consult or correspond with each other.
